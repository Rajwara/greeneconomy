              Months-old companies based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are
              aiming to bolster their own type of carbon crediting projects on
              the African continent, hoping to gain momentum for their
              initiatives as all eyes turn to their country’s role as the hosts
              of this year’s COP28 UN climate talks.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              UAE-based carbon credit project developers Green Economy
              Partnership (GEP) and Blue Carbon have signed memorandums of
              understanding (MoUs) with several African countries to explore the
              option of developing initiatives consistent with Article 6.2 of
              the Paris Agreement.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              The companies said they aim to replicate the model established by
              Switzerland, which became the first country to engage in
              country-to-country cooperation aligned to Article 6.2, having
              signed a series of six bilateral agreements and authorising the
              first credit transfers together with Ghana last November. They are
              therefore working to establish a partnership with the UAE ruling
              authorities, hoping that the federation may choose to champion
              carbon markets through its role as president and host of this
              year’s COP.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Blue Carbon in particular has related ties to the government as
              its chairman, Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Almaktoum, is a prominent
              member of Dubai’s royal family.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              “What we’re doing, is trying to leverage the actual location of
              COP28 to make sure that people know that Africa is a goldmine for
              this, but it needs to be done properly,” said GEP CEO Arthur
              Chirkinian, explaining the regional link as neighbouring
              jurisdictions. Chirkinian added that this means looking beyond the
              UAE as a source of demand, noting that while he has already
              secured buying interest from companies located in the UAE, he
              hopes to expand to private and public buyers globally.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              The companies are only months old, with Blue Carbon launching in
              October and GEP earlier this year. Both companies have only
              recently completed their websites and have not yet clarified the
              methodologies to measure results.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Though no carbon credits have been issued under the initiatives to
              date, the desire of these developers to directly link mitigation
              opportunities with credit transfers under the Paris Agreement’s
              Article 6.2 brings to light the nascent nature of the rules around
              such trades.

              FORWARD LOOKING
            </h4>
            <p className="">
              GEP is predominantly focused on developing forest-related carbon
              projects in Africa, while Blue Carbon looks to build mangrove
              restoration as well as forest projects.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              The companies aim to build investments in carbon projects that
              will leverage finance to needed areas while securing a future
              stream of credits.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              “A lot of the entities we’re dealing with have been expressing a
              desire to identify credible credits with high integrity,” said
              Chirkinian.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              “We have been suggesting that rather than investing in offsets
              already on the market, try to derive value from a social
              developmental approach,” he added.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              The company plans to help map nature-based assets, and council
              host governments on how related projects can create value through
              marketable credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              GEP signed an MOU with the government of Uganda on Jan. 19,
              through the country’s Ministry of Water and Environment – granting
              permission to conduct a feasibility study on carbon credit
              opportunities in the region – and is actively pursuing MoUs with
              other African countries. “I mean, it would be easy for me to just
              buy and sell credits,” Chirkinian said. “I do have the buyers …
              but there is a lot more value in creating long-term relationships
              vis-a-vis just making a transaction.”
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Blue Carbon, meanwhile, has signed MoUs with Tanzania and Zambia,
              and said that agreements with other countries will soon be
              revealed.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              “The [MoUs] mark an important milestone in [our] company’s efforts
              to expand blue and green carbon projects and promote sustainable
              climate change initiatives,” said Aigul Magazova, sustainability
              manager at Blue Carbon, having worked for the company since
              December. “Under the terms of the MoUs, Blue Carbon will work
              closely with the governments of Tanzania and Zambia to develop and
              implement a range of initiatives to conserve and restore
              coastal/marine as well as terrestrial ecosystems, to enhance their
              capacity to sequester carbon.”
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              “These initiatives will also focus on creating new economic
              opportunities for local communities, while promoting sustainable
              management practices and addressing climate change challenges,”
              she added.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Blue Carbon has already been under the spotlight after its
              previous carbon credit MoU signed with Papua New Guinea was
              questioned by the country’s climate delegates to COP27, who had
              not heard of the deal or how it could have been agreed in the
              absence of the country’s Climate Change Development Authority
              (CCDA).

              SWITZERLAND MODEL
            </h4>
            <p className="">
              Chirkinian said that his company is trying to mimic the approach
              taken by Switzerland, which has secured bilateral agreements with
              host country governments in order to ensure carbon credit
              purchases are recorded in national accounts, and align to overall
              development objectives.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Switzerland’s fuel importer foundation Klik then works with
              project developers to secure carbon credits in regions with MoUs
              in place.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              GEP, on the other hand, looks to establish both the project
              pipeline and the MoU with host countries, facilitating
              transactions for country-level as well as private buyers.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              As it has not yet secured any agreement with the UAE government to
              purchase credits, it aims to keep the market opportunity open to
              any interested buyers. “I’m not able to tell you we already have a
              green light from the COP28 Presidency,” Chirkinian said.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              “But we would like … to seek the permission of the COP28
              Presidency to host on the sidelines of the COP, our first
              idealised option for the credits,” he said. “And we’ll then be
              able to auction off forward-looking credits for entities and
              countries that are really committed to action.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg font-normal text-[#3c3c3c] leading-7 font-poppins mt-6">
            <h4 className="pb-2 md:pb-4 lg:mb-6  text-[#316D69] leading-7  font-bold text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-montserrat ">
              MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, VERIFICATION
            </h4>
            <p className="">
              GEP said that it does not intend to have its credits issued by one
              of the major standard bodies, such as Verra or the Gold Standard,
              but instead aims to develop its own approach to measurement,
              reporting, and verification (MRV). It is not clear how this will
              jive with emerging market-level governance and transparency
              initiatives, such as the Integrity Council on the Voluntary Carbon
              Market (IC-VCM). The IC-VCM aims to publish its core carbon
              principles in March, which would allow crediting programmes to
              apply for accreditation, essentially providing an additional stamp
              of assurance that the programme is robust. This does not mean that
              only the major crediting programmes will be approved, nor that
              major programmes are guaranteed a pass.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              If GEP and Blue Carbon were interested in IC-VCM accreditation,
              they would therefore likely need to apply as crediting programmes,
              after which their individual carbon credits could be further
              considered.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Yet Article 6.2 trades do not require accreditation of this IC-VCM
              type nor MRV assurance from a recognised VCM carbon standard, with
              the negotiations on what will be required yet to conclude.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Switzerland’s first 6.2 authorised mitigation outcome transfer,
              for example, saw an agreement on credits stemming from a Ghana
              rice farming project implemented by the UN’s Development Programme
              (UNDP).
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              The UNDP did not obtain any further accreditation for the credits
              under a major VCM standard body, but instead based the rice
              farming project on a Kyoto-era Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
              methodology.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              The methodology has since come under fire over additionality
              concerns, but the UNDP defended its use in the specific context,
              noting that the project requires a considerable scale of resources
              to train and incentivise farmers.

              UGANDA MoU
            </h4>
            <p className="">
              While GEP said that it has over 10 years of experience in the
              carbon market space, it has only very recently become a legal
              entity for the purpose of carbon credit transactions, and has also
              recently launched a company website. Beyond carbon markets, the
              January agreement with Uganda will see GEP provide advisory and
              project management services towards the development of low carbon
              strategies for forests, wetlands, natural lakes, and rivers.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              “The UAE leads with its efforts in green strategies, and the fact
              that the world chose them to host COP28 is a vote of confidence to
              their green economy initiatives and emission reduction policies,”
              Alfred Okot Okidi, permanent secretary of Uganda’s Ministry of
              Water and Environment, said in a statement last month. “We are
              confident that our partnership with the UAE-based Green Economy
              will further accelerate our commitment to transition to net zero
              goals seamlessly and leverage Uganda’s role within the African
              continent to serve as a benchmark for other counties to follow,”
              he added.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Chirkinian noted that while trades under the Paris Agreement’s
              Article 6.2 are already taking place, the mechanism will not
              become fully operational until full reporting rules are in place.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              “This is largely expected to be an outcome of COP28,” he said.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              But it remains unclear the extent that the UAE Presidency will
              prioritise progress on carbon markets, or the speed at which
              agreements can be met – particularly given these many thorny
              details related to MRV. Speaking at last month’s WEF summit in
              Davos, Majid Al Suwaidi, the UAE’s COP28 special representative,
              highlighted the need to focus on mitigation, climate finance, and
              activating the Loss and Damage fund.
